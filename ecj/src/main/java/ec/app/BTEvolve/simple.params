# The following parameter file will set up a very basic form
# of evolution, single-threaded, no coevolution, no exchanging,
# no cross-population breeding, using generational evolution,
# simple fitness, popsize=1024, etc. 
# You'll need to fill in some of the gaps.
#

# ec.Evolve
# ==============================

# simple generational evolution
state = 				ec.simple.SimpleEvolutionState



# ec.EvolutionState
# ==============================

# We're using the standard initialization method
init = 					ec.simple.SimpleInitializer

# We're using the standard (empty) finalization method
finish = 	        		ec.simple.SimpleFinisher

# We're using the standard (empty) exchange method
exch = 					ec.simple.SimpleExchanger

# We're using standard breeding -- no cross-population breeding
breed =					ec.simple.SimpleBreeder

# We're using standard evaluation -- no coevolution
eval =					ec.simple.SimpleEvaluator

# We're using simple statistics
stat =					ec.simple.SimpleStatistics
stat.num-children = 1
stat.child.0 = ec.simple.SimpleShortStatistics


#stat = ec.simple.ProjectStatistics

# run for 51 generations, quit prematurely if I find something ideal
#generations =				51
generations =				500
quit-on-run-complete =			true



# ec.Initializer
# ==============================

pop = 					ec.Population


# ec.Population
# ==============================

# No multiple populations
pop.subpops =				1
pop.subpop.0 = 				ec.Subpopulation


# ec.Subpopulation
# ==============================

# subpop size is 1024 individuals
#pop.subpop.0.size =			1024
pop.subpop.0.size = 			50
# don't bother trying to eliminate duplicates from the
# initial population
pop.subpop.0.duplicate-retries =	0

# ==You need to provide the species info for the subpopulation.==

# ec.simple.SimpleBreeder
# ==============================

# By default elitism isn't done.  If you want to do elitism for, say,
# the top 10 individuals in subpopulation 0, you'd say:

# breed.elite.0 = 			10


# ec.SimpleStatistics
# ==============================

# output statistics to the file "out.stat" in the directory
# the run was started in
stat.file =				$out.stat
stat.child.0.file = 	$out2.stat
